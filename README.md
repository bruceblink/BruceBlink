Backend-focused engineer with a strong interest in **system design, distributed systems, and low-level principles**.

I work mainly with **Java**、**Rust** and **Python**, and use **Go** for tooling and services when it fits best.  
I prefer building **production-oriented systems** rather than demos.

My work often involves:
- backend and distributed system design
- engineering-oriented web crawling & data ingestion pipelines
- networked tools (P2P, UDP, NAT traversal)
- reusable cores shared by CLI / library / GUI
